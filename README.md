# WalletHubn Test
 I will create a simple application that lists the books you have at home, in your library. i add a photo of each book. The user must be authenticated to use the application.
 My angular app meets the following requirements:
1) Demonstrates the usage of ngOnChanges, @Ouput() and @Input() | `in list add-btn and rate component`
2) Lazy load modules | `about module`
3) Demonstrates the usages of route guards | `app const route`
4) Passes data between pages. Have an input field in one page of which contents is
displayed in the second page.
5) Has page transition animations. Here please make 2 examples, one with angularanimations and one that uses just css classes with animations for things like fading in an
element.
6) Has one route that demonstrates how nested <router-outlet> works.
7) Have 2 inputs with some simple validation (like an email validation) without the require
of angular-forms and ngModel
8) Demonstrates the usage of ng-content | `add btn`.
9) Have an input directive that restricts the input to numbers only and auto formats the input
into currency, ex: $1,234. The field must change its format as user types. | `IN HEADER CURRENCY INPUT`
10) Demonstrates various ways to bind component properties to an associated template
11) Has unit tests.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
